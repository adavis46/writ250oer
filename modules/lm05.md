# Habits of Mind
This module gives you some vocabulary to help you think about writing and research in your major. Since this class is all about developing strategies for writing and research, we should start with defining what exactly a strategy is in this context.

## What does academic writing mean?
First, we should start off by talking about what academic writing really means. You’ve probably heard those words before in previous classes, but for this course in particular, Academic Writing is how professional scholars communicate with each other. It’s how knowledge is created, spread, and debated among professionals in different fields. Every field that’s represented in the university has its own kind of academic writing, How a history professor writes about history and how a Social Work professor writes about history might be very different, but some fundamental rules apply in both cases. We’ll be breaking down those rules this semester.

So how does that apply to you? You are “inventing” academic writing each time you sit down to an essay assignment. You have to effectively translate your own ideas into a very specific type of writing. We call this process entering a discourse community. The ability to enter a discourse community, and participate with it, is invaluable for any career you might pursue.

## Academic Writing is Argument 

All academic writing is argument. Really, every kind of writing is making an argument, if you really think about it. Here are some different types of argument that academic writing might engage in:

1. Define a situation that calls for response.  
This kind of writing explains a problem, gives context for its origins, and reviews the current “state” of the problem. We call this problematizing.

2. Demonstrate the timeliness of an argument.  
In this kind of writing, the goal is to make an audience realize how important something is. Oftentimes, this is a part of problematizing.

3. Establish a personal investment.  
In some fields, this kind of argument is discouraged. In others, though, the author’s personal stake in the issue is relevant, and contributes to his or her credibility

4. Appeal to readers whose minds you want to change.  
The goal of lots of arguments is to challenge existing ideas. Part of doing that means breaking down what an audience thinks is important, and why.

5. Supporting another argument with reasons.  
Some academic writing exists to support, or underscore existing academic writing.

6. Anticipate and address readers’ reasons for disagreement.  
This can sometimes take the form of a refutation or a response piece.

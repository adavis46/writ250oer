<h1>Engaging Research Sources</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What kinds of research have you done for past classes? If you took Writing 102 at the University of Mississippi, you probably wrote a research-based argument paper that required you to use a certain number of academic sources. You may have used research to write papers in history or philosophy classes, too. There is more to research than just writing papers for classes, though. Research is required in all kinds of professions, both inside and outside of the academy. This class is all about research and writing within your own discipline, or major. Hopefully, the work you'll do for Writing 250 will influence how you think about the conversations that take place in your major classes.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many different approaches to research, but you'll probably use one of these two for your projects in this class:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">You already have a vague topic in mind, and you want to find research sources to help you develop a specific research question. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">If you already have a question in mind, you can use sources to start formulating an answer to the question. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Where you start probably depends on how familiar you are with the academic conversations taking place in your major. Don't worry, though: after you finish the first major assignment, you'll have a much better understanding of how research works in your major.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This module is made up of several different types of media. First, you'll read an essay about how Google and <span><span>Wikipedia</span></span> are essential parts of the research process. Then, you'll learn more about what distinguishes an academic source from a non-academic source, and you'll conclude with a tour of library resources available to you here at UM. </span></p>

<h1>Determining Whether Sources are Academic</h1>

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>CC-BY 2015 Karla L<span><span>yles</span></span> and the WRIT 250 Curriculum Co<span><span>mmittee</span> </span></em></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">ll of our writing assignments this semester require you to read academic and/or professional research and to integrate that research into your writing, but how do you know if a source is academic, professional, or popular? The information below is intended to help you understand the differences among academic, professional, and popular sources so that you can ensure you are meeting assignment requirements and drawing on the most reliable information for your projects.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">What is an academic source?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When we refer to an “academic” or “scholarly” source, we often are calling attention to that source having undergone a process known as peer review. Peer review is an approach to critiquing a manuscript submitted for publication and means that a group of academics (professors and/or others affiliated with universities) has received the manuscript, read and commented on it, and decided whether the manuscript should be accepted for publication, revised for potential future acceptance, or rejected.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Academic journals commonly rely on peer review to decide whether a manuscript should be published, and generally the process occurs like this: </span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1.    An author submits his/her article manuscript to a journal;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">2.      The journal editor determines whether the article draft meets the basic publication criteria</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of the journal and then selects a group of outside reviewers (often three or more) who are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">generally experts in the subject area to read and review the manuscript;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">3.      The editor submits the manuscript to the reviewers who do not know the identity of the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">author (this is why peer review is sometimes referred to as a “blind review”) so that they </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">can review the manuscript as objectively as possible;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">4.      The reviewers read and write comments about the article that are sent to the editor along </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">with the reviewers’ recommendations to either publish the manuscript as is (this rarely </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">happens), to publish it with revisions, or to reject it for publication;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">5.      The editor contacts the author to let him/her know the outcome of the review and to send </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">along the reviewers’ feedback;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">6.      If the article was accepted for publication as is then the author does not need to make </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">changes to the manuscript and his/her article will appear in the journal at a later date;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">7.      If the article was accepted for publication following revisions then the author must make </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">changes to the manuscript, resubmit the manuscript for another review, and then provided </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the changes are accepted the article will appear in the journal at a later date;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">8.      If the article was rejected then it will not be published or considered further for possible </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">publication. If the article is rejected then the author may choose to submit the article to </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">another journal for review (manuscripts typically can only be reviewed by one journal at </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">a time) or to revise or abandon the project.</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">As you can tell, the process of peer review is rigorous and often lengthy, sometimes taking months to complete. It helps to ensure as much as possible that the proposed publication presents valid research that will interest the target <span><span>audience—fellow</span></span> academics. Some academic journals are more selective than others in terms of the percentage of submitted manuscripts they publish (for example, some journals may publish as little as 30% of manuscripts that are submitted whereas others may publish 50%), but regardless, the peer review process helps to try to ensure the quality of the research.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are uncertain whether a source you are considering using for an assignment is published in an academic journal then you can easily search Google for the journal’s title. Academic journals have <span><span>webpages</span></span> hosted by the publishers responsible for those journals (for example, publishers include Wiley-Blackwell, <span><span>Routledge</span></span>, Taylor &amp; Francis, etc.), and the typical website for an academic journal will include the following sections:</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1.      Aims and scope (this section of the site offers a brief summary/overview of the journal, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">including the topics the journal publishes about, the target audience(s) for the journal, the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">frequency of publication, etc.);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">2.      Editorial board (this section of the site identifies the journal editor and his/her university </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">affiliation as well as the names and university affiliations of the other members of the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">board);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">3.      Submission guidelines or Instructions for authors (this section of the site explains how </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">authors should format their manuscripts as well as the peer review process)</span></p>
<p><br /> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When consulting a journal’s website look for the above sections as well as the keywords</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">“peer review.” An academic journal’s website also will commonly include an image of the front cover of the journal (typically appearing in the top left corner of the homepage), which you do not tend to see for other kinds of publications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">            </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now that you know some strategies for how to determine whether an article is an academic journal article, below are some strategies to help you determine whether a book or a website is scholarly as well. For our assignments you will primarily consult academic journal articles, but you may choose to integrate academic books or websites as additional resources with instructor permission.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When trying to decide whether a book is academic, search for information about the following:</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1.      Publisher (the name of the publisher of any book should be visible on the outside cover </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of the book and/or within the first few pages where all publication information is </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">provided; if you cannot tell from the name itself that the publisher is academic, such as </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the University of Chicago Press, then search Google for the publisher name to see what </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">information is available about the kinds of materials the company publishes);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">2.         Author (some books include a “blurb” that identifies the university affiliation of the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">author if he/she is an academic, and often this blurb is found on the back cover; if this </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">information is not available, though, then a Google search for the author’s name will </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">often turn up a university faculty <span><span>webpage</span></span> if the author is an academic/still affiliated with </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">a university);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">3.         Audience (this is perhaps the hardest feature to determine, but to help you decide </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">whether a book’s audience is academic, consider features of the book such as the chapter </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">titles in the table of contents, the language used throughout the book that would suggest </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">scholarly or highly technical knowledge, and the topics listed in the back index)</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">*Note that although textbooks are used in academic settings, they often are not considered “academic” sources because of their purposes. Whereas academic journal articles and books report original research to inform the field, textbooks generally focus on <span><span>overviewing</span></span> theories, events, figures, etc. For our class textbooks will not be “counted” as academic sources to fulfill assignment requirements, and in your other classes you should consult with your teachers to find out whether textbooks are considered “scholarly.”</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, how do you determine whether a website is an academic website? Consider the following when trying to decide whether a website is scholarly:</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1.         URL of the site (if the URL ends with .<span><span>edu</span></span> that indicates the site has a university </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">affiliation; .<span><span>org</span></span> and .com sites are rarely scholarly websites);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">2.         Name of the person/group responsible for the site (often a website features an “About </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Me” or “About Us” section that will tell you the affiliation(s) of the site author(s); if </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">necessary, search Google for the name(s) of the site author(s) to get further information);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">3.         Appearance of the site (an academic site typically will have a more professional and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">streamlined appearance than a popular website, for example, which may have a bright </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">color background, long lists of links, and font such as Comic Sans);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">4.        Audience (the appearance of the site can suggest who the target audience is, but the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">content of the site will as well; read/skim the content to see what kind of language is </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">used, whether formal/academic or more casual, as well as to see what kind of information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">is the focus)</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">What is a professional source?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">            For all of your disciplines there are professional organizations that provide information for practitioners as well as perhaps the public. Although these organizations may conduct and publish their own research, that research is not necessarily carried out by academics or intended for academics. This does not mean that the information is unreliable; rather, it means that the purposes of the research are different as are the audience and process of publication (specifically, peer review is not necessarily used).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">As an example, if you access the website for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (<a href="http://www.asha.org/"><span><span>http</span></span>://<span><span>www</span></span>.<span><span>asha</span></span>.<span><span>org</span></span>/</a>) you will see a link at the top of the page for “Research.” If you click that link you are then shown a directory of linked resources, and the titles of the linked pages suggest that the sources are meant for professionals (who would use these sources to inform their practice/work) rather than academics. For example, if you click “Key Steps in the EBP Process,” the page that appears list links for you that will provide practice-oriented information (framing a clinical question, gathering and assessing evidence, and making a decision). In general academics would probably not consult this information for their research since its focus is on how to perform certain professional tasks. When determining whether a source is professional, ask whether the source is intended to help the reader more effectively perform in his/her professional duties, offering “practical” information rather than more “theoretical” content and/or primary research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Websites that feature .<span><span>org</span></span> in their <span><span>URLs</span></span> tend to be professional/organizational sites rather than academic, and you can refer to the “About Us” section (if available) for further information to help you determine whether the site is maintained by a professional individual or group rather than a university-affiliated individual or group. Other common professional sources include manuals and handbooks (print and electronic), such as a guide instructing the reader on how to conduct an interview as a social worker, and additional print and electronic material that informs the reader about the state of the profession and how to successfully participate in it.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">What is a popular source? </span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">            In contrast to academic and (typically) professional sources, popular sources target the general public. You will notice that these sources tend to be more accessible in terms of ease of reading, using more casual language and providing content that the majority of people could understand. This is not to say that all popular sources are meant for the general public to read; for example, a <span><span>blog</span></span> is a common popular source and can be written for a group with highly specialized knowledge, such as mechanics. In general, though, popular sources can appeal to a much wider range of people than academic or professional sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">            Common popular sources include news and magazine articles (whether print or electronic), films/TV shows, trade books, etc.</span></p>

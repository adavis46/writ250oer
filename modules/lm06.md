# The Annotated Bibliography
Before you get started on Deliverable 2, it is important to get a good grasp on what the remainder of this course is going to look like, and what exactly you’re going to be doing. This learning module will walk you through the first steps for the Writing 250 Research Project. This project may be different from other types of writing and research papers you've done in school so far. Some terms, concepts, and genres may be unfamiliar, but keep in mind that this course is designed to introduce you to the academic conversation: you might be frustrated at first, but you'll eventually get the hang of it.

## Getting Started with the Topic Proposal
At the beginning of the course, when we talked about the overall purpose of Writing 250, you’ll remember that we emphasized that this course is about writing for and about your discipline or major. Our goal is to give you the tools you need to participate in the academic conversation taking place in your field. You will accomplish this goal by creating a large-scale research project, and going through all the initial steps of developing a research question, doing secondary research, and planning primary research. What makes this course a little bit different is that you won’t actually write a research paper. You’ll do everything leading up to it and your efforts will culminate in a formal research study design, or [Prospectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_note), that proposes a large-scale, realistic primary research project in your field. You don’t have the time or the resources to conduct much actual primary research, but designing the methods for a real research study will help you to understand how the work in the real world. 

The informal topic proposal (this week’s journal entry) serves as the foundation for the rest of the project. Though it’s a small assignment, it’s very important. Your task is propose a research project in your field that would answer a specific research question. This research project will include a preliminary description of a potential primary study to go along with the existing secondary research that you will begin accumulating this week. What is a primary study? Basically, any research that’s “hands on” is [primary research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_research). This can include surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, or even work with primary documents (like tax returns, annual reports, or other kinds of raw data). This differs from [secondary research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_research), or “library” research, in that you, as the researcher, are not separated from the original source of information. 

For example, a journal article about the results of a study that used a survey and a set of interviews is a secondary source because there are at least two steps between the original information and you, the reader. At the very least, an author or researcher has interpreted the information and put it into an essay. The primary research consists of the survey and the interviews themselves

## The Annotated Bibliography: The Big Picture
This section will walk you through the annotated bibliography assignment, and how it fits in with the writing projects you'll be completing this semester.

The annotated bibliography is the first major assignment in the Writing 250 research project. This project, based on the study you outlined in your informal research proposal (Journal 3), will occupy you for the rest of the semester. Though some of the particulars of the project may change, you will essentially be working with the same topic from now on.

Annotated bibliographies are designed to help you get a feel for the range of research and scholarship extant in your field in the area of your topic. Since any original research project must be firmly rooted in existing research, the annotated bibliography is the first step in assembling that foundation of secondary scholarship.

More concretely, though, the annotated bibliography is a tool to help you organize your own research and writing workflow. If you approach this assignment with the right mindset, and really put thought into your annotations, the quotations you choose, and the content of your introduction, you'll find that you will have already assembled some of the major components of deliverable 3, the literature review.

Your annotated bibliography should review 6 to 8 academic sources on your topic. That means they must come from academic journals. Most likely, you'll be using the same five journals you located for Journal 2. You may only use a non-academic or popular-press source with permission (and most likely I'm going to tell you to dig harder for an academic source that's equivalent to the one you want to use). This is necessary because new research (like the study you are designing) is only considered credible (and only has a strong [ethos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos) appeal) if it is directly tied to existing credible research. In order for other experts in your field to take your ideas seriously, you must prove that you are familiar with the discourse community that they are members of. The exploratory essay was designed to give you a better sense of what that [discourse community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_community) looks like.

## The Annotated Bibliography: Citation and Summary
Ideally, the 6 to 8 journal articles you locate should be from the last 5 to 10 years. If you want to use an older source, you have to have a specific reason for using it. Perhaps it's a critical piece of historical research on your topic, or it's a study that has gone been largely ignored that you think deserves greater attention. But, you can't use an old source just because it shows up first in your search results.

Once you have located all of your sources, you should write a complete and correct APA-style citation of each source. Please review the [Purdue OWL site](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) or the interactive APA Style Learning Module in this week’s folder to familiarize yourself with APA style. Again, this part saves you time later on. If you format your references correctly now, you won't have to worry about that for assignments 3 and 4.

For each source, you should write a thoughtful summary or [rhetorical précis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pr%C3%A9cis). The next section of this module will show specifically what a rhetorical précis looks like if you want to use that format. Each sentence has a specific purpose. If you follow the formula, what you'll end up with is a concise, four-sentence summary of your source and its significance to your research project. You aren’t required to use the precis format, but you might find that you’ll write less if you use a formulaic approach to summary. Remember, a summary should be the Reader’s Digest version of the source. What are the most important parts? What was the study about? What was the conclusion? A summary should demonstrate that you [understand the source](http://depts.washington.edu/owrc/Handouts/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Summary.pdf) and that you’re able to integrate it into your research project.

An annotation briefly restates the main argument of a source. An annotation of an academic source, for example, typically identifies its thesis (or research question, or hypothesis), its major methods of investigation, and its main conclusions. Keep in mind that identifying the argument of a source is a different task than describing or listing its contents. Rather than listing contents (Example 1 below), an annotation should account for why the contents are there (Example 2). The formula for a rhetorical précis is especially helpful if you have never written an annotated bibliography from a rhetorical analysis perspective, and we will use this model for the assignment.

Ex. 1 Only lists contents (Avoid this)

McIvor, S. D. (1995). Aboriginal women’s rights as “existing rights.” Canadian Woman Studies/Les Cahiers de la Femme, 2/3, 34-38.

This article discusses recent constitutional legislation as it affects the human rights of aboriginal women in Canada: the Constitution Act (1982), its amendment in 1983, and amendments to the Indian Act (1985). It also discusses the implications for aboriginal women of the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation of the Constitution Act in R. v. Sparrow (1991).

Ex. 2: Identifies the argument; considers the rhetorical situation (Provide this)

McIvor, S. D. (1995). Aboriginal women’s rights as “existing rights.” Canadian Woman Studies/Les Cahiers de la Femme 2/3, 34-38.

This article seeks to define the extent of the civil and political rights returned to aboriginal women in the Constitution Act (1982), in its amendment in 1983, and in amendments to the Indian Act (1985). This legislation reverses prior laws that denied Indian status to aboriginal women who married non-aboriginal men. On the basis of the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation of the Constitution Act in R. v. Sparrow (1991), McIvor argues that the Act recognizes fundamental human rights and existing aboriginal rights, granting to aboriginal women full participation in the aboriginal right to self-government.

## The Rhetorical Précis 
**Using a Rhetorical Précis formula for annotations**

Using the formula is not mandatory, but if you lack experience, you will find as you work with this approach that it becomes easier to do without trying to follow the “formula.” So if you decide to follow and use this formula, that’s acceptable and you won’t be graded down for that. But if you want to situate your annotation within its rhetorical situation (credibility of author, target audience, purpose, context, strategies used, etc.) using your own approach, then you are encouraged to do so.

The rhetorical précis is based on the work of Margaret Woodworth, and is a highly structured four-sentence paragraph that provides the essential elements of a unit of spoken or written discourse. Each sentence requires specific information.

1. WHAT: In a single coherent sentence, give the following:
* Name of the author, title of the work, with source and date in parentheses;
* A rhetorically accurate verb such as “asserts,” “argues,” “refutes,” “proves,” or “ explains.”
* A that clause containing the major claim (thesis statement) of the work.

2. HOW: In a single coherent sentence, give an explanation of how the writer develops and supports the major claim (the main point or thesis statement).

3. WHY: In a single coherent sentence, give a statement of the author’s purpose, followed by an “in order to” phrase.

4. WHO: In a single coherent sentence, give a description of the intended audience and/or the relationship the author establishes with the audience.

### Sample:

In her article “Who Cares if Johnny Can’t Read?,” Larissa MacFarquhar asserts that Americans are reading more than ever before despite claims to the contrary and that it is time to reconsider why we value reading so much, especially certain kinds of “high culture” reading. MacFarquhar supports her claims about American reading habits with facts and statistics that compare past and present reading practices, and she challenges common assumptions by raising questions about the intrinsic value of reading. Her purpose is to dispel certain myths about reading in order to raise new and more important questions about the value of reading and other media in our culture. She seems to have a young, hip, somewhat irreverent audience in mind because her tone is sarcastic, and she suggests that the ideas she opposes are old-fashioned positions.

The above sample was posted by Amy Chastain to http://collegewritingrhetoric.blogspot.com/2011/02/rhetorical-precis.html.

## The Annotated Bibliography: Evaluation and Analysis 
Your second paragraph for each annotation should be an evaluation or analysis of the source. Specifically, you want to explain how you will use this source as part of your research project, and why. For example, what makes the source stand out? What makes it more credible, relevant, or current than other sources on the same topic? This is also where you should attempt to start synthesizing your sources. Synthesis basically means "putting together," or putting things in conversation. For assignment 3, the literature review, you'll be writing about how the sources in your annotated bibliography overlap; where do they agree, disagree, or come to consensus? If you start noticing some trends in this conversation among your sources, it's a good idea to bring them up in your evaluation paragraph. It'll make your Literature Review project that much easier.

### Evaluating the Relevance and Value of a source
Your annotation should now go on to briefly assess the value of the source to an investigation of your research question. If your bibliography is part of a research project, briefly identify how you intend to use the source and why. If your bibliography is an independent project, assess the source's contribution to the research on your topic. Keep in mind models for assessing arguments in your course materials and discipline.

* Are you interested in the way the source frames its research question or in the way it goes about answering that question (its method)? Does the source make new connections or open up new ways of seeing a problem? How effective is the method of investigation? (e.g. bringing the Sparrow decision concerning aboriginal fishing rights to bear on the scope of women’s rights) *What are gaps/flaws/limitations of the method(s)?
* Are you interested in the way the source uses a theoretical framework or a key concept? Why do you find this use valuable? Is it problematic in some ways? (e.g. analysis of existing, extinguished, and other kinds of rights)
* Does the source gather and analyze a particular body of evidence that you want to use? How good is the evidence? (e.g. the historical development of a body of legislation)
* How do the source’s conclusions bear on your own investigation? *How can you integrate the source into your own research and writing?

## The Annotated Bibliography: The introduction
Finally, you should write an introduction for the entire annotated bibliography. In the introduction, you should explain the context of the sources and why they are relevant to your research project. What are some overall trends that you see? Is there disagreement in the research, or consensus? Are there any obvious gaps in the research? Basically, your introduction is an analysis of your annotations themselves, and how they fit together. Hopefully, you'll have identified much of this material in your evaluation paragraphs, and the introduction will be more of a recap.

All of this will lead directly into the literature review, which you'll start working in the coming weeks. The two assignments are very closely related, but they have different rhetorical purposes. Generally, though, if you do well on the annotated bibliography and you put a lot of effort into curating your secondary research, you'll do well on the literature review too.

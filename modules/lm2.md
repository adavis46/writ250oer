# Critical Thinking and Critical Conversations 
## Introduction

This module is designed to review some of the basic concepts of rhetoric and the rhetorical situation that form the foundation of your work in the course. Part of being a researcher involves participating in an academic conversation. Kenneth Burke, a 20th century philosophy and theorist, posed this metaphor that can be applied to the academic conversation:

Imagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about. In fact, the discussion had already begun long before any of them got there, so that no one present is qualified to retrace for you all the steps that had gone before. You listen for a while, until you decide that you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers; you answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself against you, to either the embarrassment or gratification of your opponent, depending upon the quality of your ally's assistance. However, the discussion is interminable. The hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress. - [The Philosophy of Literary Form](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Philosophy_of_Literary_Form.html?id=9zuXtQtNbowC) , 110-111

So, if you think about your major or discipline as the conversation, the writing you'll do for this course will help you enter the conversation. Another term for this idea is [discourse community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_community). Being a successful researcher requires that you develop a keen understanding of your fiend's discourse community. The first steps are to develop an understanding of [audience](http://owl.excelsior.edu/posts/view/13) and [purpose](http://owl.excelsior.edu/posts/view/12)]. The next two pages of content will help you think some more about what it means to enter an academic conversation.

## Critical Thinking and Rhetoric 
Take a look at the video lecture below (or read the transcript). What do you remember about rhetoric from your First-Year composition course? Do the words logos, pathos, and ethos ring a bell? This short video will help you remember some of the concepts you learned before, and explain how they relate to the research writing you will do in this class.

### Text Transcript of video
This module is designed to review some of the fundamental concepts of the rhetorical situation and critical thinking that this course is built on. This review will give you a refresher on the vocabulary you find in the textbook, course modules, and major assignments. 

What is critical thinking? Critical thinking is linked to skepticism. Part of being critical means never accepting anything as truth without careful analysis. This is one of the most important skills you can learn in college. Being skeptical allows you to understand the complexity of ideas, and articulate your own beliefs with greater sophistication. When approaching new ideas in your research, you should be skeptical of your own attitude, assumptions and your own concept of evidence. This doesn't mean that you should second guess yourself: it just means that in order to be an effective critical thinker, you have to be able to defend your ideas. 

Before you can begin analyzing or questioning the ideas of others (and evaluating their research), you must first learn to question your own attitudes, assumptions, and evidence. The first stept in skeptical criticism is investigation. In order to be useful, investigation needs a structure. We call that structure a "heuristic." That may sound intimidating, but all a heuristic is is a method or process of adopting ideas. I like to put emphasis on the word "process." One idea leads to another, and so on. 

We use heuristics every day for all kinds of mundane things, but when it comes to developing a research and writing process based in critical thinking, it's essential that we are conscious of the exact method we use to construct ideas. What is the relationship between heuristics and topics? In order to begin developing effective heuristics for analysis of an idea, you should try to establish its topic, or "topos." 

In the classical tradition, these topics are Definition, Comparison, Relationship, and Testimony. In writing, these topics can sometimes translate to genres or modes. For example, the "topos" of definition usually applies to expository writing, like reports and news stories. On the other hand, comparison and relationship might apply to analytical or synthesis writing. What this really means is that you have to develop a heuristic, or method of writing, for each type of writing you are tasked with. 

What is rhetoric? We often hear the word "rhetoric" used pejoratively  in the media to describe political speeches or other less-than-ethical discourse. However, rhetoric is really just using language to persuade, inform, educate, or entertain. Language is a fairly broad term. What do you think of as language? Is math rhetorical? Is science rhetorical? What about images? We'll discuss these as the course goes on. But, keep in mind that the words "language" and "text" have a much broader meaning than you're used to hearing. The rhetorical situation also relies on another trope called the rhetorical triangle. You might have heard this before. The rhetorical triangle represents the balance of ethos, pathos, and logos. 

If you look at the roots of these words, you might be able to define them. Logos, with the root "log," refers to the appeal to facts or to logic. In rhetoric, logos represents things that we know to be true. We know that the earth is round, and we know that one plus one equals two. Pathos, with the root "path," refers to the appeal to emotion or to feeling. Pathos represents the use of rhetorical techniques designed to create feelings in the audience. Ethos is the appeal to authority, with "eth" being the root. Ethos represents your credibility and trustworthiness as an arguer. 
The rhetorical situation is the balance of these three appeals. What the balance looks like can vary based on occasion. We'll talk about these more as the course goes on.

## Module Summary
Now that you have reviewed the basics of rhetoric and learned about the academic conversation, you're ready to start work on your exploratory essay. Your research journal assignment(s) this week will help you begin to formulate topic ideas and an understanding of library research. Feel free to come back to this module at any time for clarification.
